# Hello and good morning!
## Lets Practice a little javascript before we get into Python.


### For this assignment we will not have our laptops out and we will solve them with pen and paper. 

1. Write a function that takes two parameters and returns the sum of the two paramaters.

2. Write a function that takes a string and returns the string in reverse.

3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers in a random order and returns a new array of those numbers in order from largest to smallest.

4. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a function that returns a of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
